Experience
----------

I have spent over 6 years as an Investment Banker in London, starting out in Mergers and Acquisitions in HSBC before moving into Debt Advisory at a boutique investment bank. I have therefore had experience of working in both large and small companies and teams. Past clients have mostly been UK and European private equity firms, as well as mid-cap companies with valuations of c.£150-200 million.

The vast majority of my past experience has been project-based, working in teams of around 3 to 4 people. I am used to delivering high quality work under tight, client-driven deadlines. My past roles have been client-facing, where I was expected to prepare and present project findings and financial models.
